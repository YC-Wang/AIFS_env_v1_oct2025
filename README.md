# üåê Project: AIFS Ensemble Inference

This document describes the setup and execution steps for running **AIFS ensemble inference** on the ATOS system.

---

## I. Build the Environment

### 1. Load Conda on ATOS
```bash
module load conda
```

### 2. Create a Conda Environment
As the environment is built with a mixture of conda and pip, installation of the environment needs to be done mannually on ATOS.
We are currently investigating if there is any preinstalled package on ATOS that can be used.

```bash
# Create and activate environment
conda create -n env_test_anemoi python=3.11.6
conda activate env_test_anemoi

# Install packages individually
pip install torch==2.5.0
pip install anemoi-inference[huggingface]==0.6.0
pip install anemoi-models==0.6.0
pip install anemoi-graphs==0.6.0
pip install anemoi-datasets==0.5.23
pip install "earthkit-regrid==0.4.0" "ecmwf-opendata>=0.3.19"
```

* Before installing falsh_attn, need to install cuda first.
```
conda install -c nvidia cuda-toolkit=12.4
pip install flash_attn==2.7.3
```
---

## II. Test the Environment

You can interactively test the setup using:
```bash
ecinteractive -g
```

---

## III. Download Model Checkpoint

Download the pretrained model from Hugging Face:
üîó [AIFS ENS 1.0 Checkpoint](https://huggingface.co/ecmwf/aifs-ens-1.0/blob/main/aifs-ens-crps-1.0.ckpt)

---

## IV. Generate Initial Conditions from IFS Archive

Use the provided script to generate the initial condition file:
```bash
vi input/download_aifs.sh
```

---

## V. Set Up the Experiment

Edit your configuration file (e.g., `reg_emi_2015_48h.yaml`) as follows:

```yaml
checkpoint: <path_cktpt>/aifs-ens-crps-1.0.ckpt
lead_time: 48
input:
  grib: <path_IC>/aifs_input_state_20230514_n320_18z_20230515_00z.grib
output:
  grib: <path_output>/output_ens_dana_italy.grib
```

---

## VI. Run the Experiment on SLURM

Submit the job script:
```bash
sbatch slurm_aifs_ens_1000.sh
```

Upon successful start of the run, GRIB output files will appear in the directory specified in the configuration file.

Note: These output files are in a mixed GRIB1 and GRIB2 format. If using cdo, you must first separate them using wgrib and wgrib2.

Common errors:
1. errors when loading the model: flash_attn version + cuda
import flash_attn_2_cuda as flash_attn_gpu
ImportError: /lib64/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.32' not found (required by /perm/swe0632/conda/envs/env_test_anemoi/lib/python3.11/site-packages/flash_attn_2_cuda.cpython-311-x86_64-linux-gnu.so)

2. reverse the anemoi.utils version.
> conda install anemoi.utils=0.4.22
